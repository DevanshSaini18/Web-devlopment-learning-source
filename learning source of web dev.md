                                Assignment: Web

You are completely free to make your assignments more creative and interactive using some bootstrapping or javascript libraries.  Efforts and Creativity will be the primary judging criteria for the assignment. Choose any one out of these 6 based on your proficiency in the topics. Questions are arranged in increasing level of their difficulty

Make a page using HTML CSS - Freedom to add any extra element (Easiest)
Styling using bootstrap may fetch you brownie points
The assignments home page should include an internal style sheet—within the <head> section —with at least two different CSS rule sets.
The assignments home page should include two or more different inline style rules—as style attributes of HTML elements.
One .css document with at least six different CSS rule sets
Style rules should specify font family and font size for paragraph and heading text, and link states: link, visited, hover, and active.
A background image and/or background colour should be specified for the pages. Some other aspect of the CSS box model, such as border, margin, or padding, should also be styled.
Two or more HTML class attributes, targeted and styled with CSS
An HTML id attribute, targeted and styled with CSS
Text Content doesn’t matter (use lorem ipsum text)
A must-have nav-bar
Make a loader or a well-styled hamburger icon in bootstrap
Entire first question + a loader/hamburger
Make a responsive carousel/image slider that adds some transition to images
First Question + carousel
HTML CSS Bootstrap
Use Js for brownie points
Make a “like” button functionality similar to that of Facebook (include all reacts)
Javascript- jQuery
HTML - CSS
Bootstrap
Make a drag and drop functionality that displays a message e.g. a ball when dragged to a spot alerts a message or displays the optional material(don’t do this XD) (toughest)
E.g Bubbles floating and when you click them, they pop but one bubble doesn’t pop and that bubble, when dragged by the user at some position, results in an alert
Particle JS - javascript library for some cool animations and effects
Brownie points if instead of alert, you display a form(just a text input field and a button).
Make it responsive too according to your understanding of design.
Alternatively, you may choose any interactive effect (coupled with scrolling) that you find around as a topic e.g. typewriter effects, parallax effects etc. (toughest)
        

[A clarification - If you are doing Q6, make sure to use SCROLLING libraries like aos along with effect of your choice]


Note: Questions are written in increasing level of their difficulty. Don’t worry about judgement. It’ll be done in a way that could be fair to everyone.
